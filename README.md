Hi!!
## About Me

I started my coding journey with a simple attendance tracker. That project sparked my interest in building practical tools, and since then, I've steadily expanded my skills and portfolio. Today, my repositories reflect a range of interests, from automation and web development to machine learning and AI.

## My Journey

- **First Steps:**  
  My initial project was an attendance tracker, which has oveer 50 users using it, it is a simple, practical tool that taught me the basics of coding, version control, and problem-solving.

- **Growth:**  
  As I gained confidence, I began exploring web technologies and automation, creating small apps and scripts to solve everyday problems. Apps in progress to be uploaded on the Google Play store.

- **AI & Research:**  
  Most recently, I've focused on machine learning, working with models like Flan-T5. I trained, tuned, and deployed AI solutions, and in the making learned a valuable lesson through my first project which was a disaster which almost burned my laptop's battery trying to train a large dataset on it, ever since then I use google collab.
