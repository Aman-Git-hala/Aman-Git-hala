Hi!!

## About Me

I started my coding journey with a simple attendance tracker. That project sparked my interest in building practical tools, and since then, I've steadily expanded my skills and portfolio. Today, my repositories reflect a range of interests, from automation and web development to machine learning and AI.

## My Journey

- **First Steps** — *TL;DR: Wrote code → It worked → People used it → Got hooked.*  
  My initial project was an attendance tracker, which has over 50 users using it. It is a simple, practical tool that taught me the basics of coding, version control, and problem-solving.

- **Growth** — *TL;DR: Solved my own problems → Accidentally built apps → Now shipping them.*  
  As I gained confidence, I began exploring web technologies and automation, creating small apps and scripts to solve everyday problems. Apps are in progress to be uploaded on the Google Play store.

- **AI & Research** — *TL;DR: Tried to build Skynet on my laptop → Laptop nearly died → Learned cloud computing.*  
  Most recently, I've focused on machine learning, working with models like Flan-T5. I trained, tuned, and deployed AI solutions, and in the process learned a valuable lesson through my first project — which was a disaster that almost burned my laptop's battery trying to train a large dataset. Ever since, I use Google Colab.
